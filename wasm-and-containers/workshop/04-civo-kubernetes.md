Now we are ready to deploy to Civo's Kubernetes service.

## 1. Create a Civo Account

Head over to https://civo.com and create an account if you don't have one already.

## 2. Create a Kubernetes cluster

Through the dashboard, create a new Kubernetes cluster. The defaults should be fine for our purposes.

## 3. Configure Spin runtime on Civo Kubernetes

The easiest way to get Spin support in Civo is to use the excellent [KWasm](https://kwasm.sh/) project.

In the [Quickstart guide](https://kwasm.sh/quickstart/), follow the instructions for Civo and Spin

## 4. Deploy a Spin app to the Kubernetes cluster
